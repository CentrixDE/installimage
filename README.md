## How does it work
* Installation quickness is achieved through utilization of prepared tar-ball images, which contain a root-filesystem tree. (e.g. the distro specific bootstrap process is skipped.)
* Base-configuration of the newly installed system is supplied through a selection of shell-scripts.
